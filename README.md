_Vision: Violet is your personal songwriting assistant. She will recommend strategies to turn your ideas into songs, and ping you regularly to help establish a discipline around writing._

Immediate next steps: 

* Correct the React bug that causes main component to render twice.
  - FreewritesController#index is being called twice from the Rails API. Figure out why this is happening.

* Complete Devise implementation for authentication/authorization.

* Extract Freewriting Entry functionality to it's own page, and style the homepage.

* Add routes and Redux.
